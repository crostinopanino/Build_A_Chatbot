# Assignment 2: Build A Chatbot 

This chatbot was created for the GoTravel! website to assist a travel blogger in accessing weather data for their specified itinerary.

## Getting Started

Before running the chatbot, make sure to install all the necessary dependencies. The `requirements.txt` file lists all the required Python libraries.
### Installing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
- Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/crostinopanino/Build_A_Chatbot.git`

- Navigate to the project directory:

`cd Build_A_Chatbot`

- Install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Setup the database for the Chatbot by running the `setup_database.py` script:

`python setup_database.py`

## Usage

The chatbot can be interacted with through the web interface provided by the Flask app. Here are a few example commands:

- **Weather Inquiry**: "What's the weather like in Oxford?"
- **Activity Suggestions**: "Suggest an activity for a rainy day in Cambridge."
